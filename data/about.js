    body: `**Polygons** are flat, two-dimensional shapes that contain just straight sides. A circle, for example, is not a polygon, because it is curved. Here are some examples of polygons:

![](polygons =300x220)

A **regular polygon** is a polygon in which all sides and all internal angles have the same size:

![](regular =300x200)

We can combine multiple polygons to form 3-dimensional solids called **polyhedra**. 

![](polyhedra =300x150)

The polygons that make up a polyhedron are called **faces**. The lines where two faces meet are called **edges**, and the corners are called **vertices**.

    body: `Regular polygons were particularly symmetric polygons. In the same way, we can try to come up with conditions for particularly symmetric _polyhedra_.

A **Platonic solid** is a polyhedron with two conditions: every face is the same kind of regular polygon, and the same number of faces meet at every vertex.

![](platonic =300x220)

It turns out that there are only five different Platonic solids. They were discovered by the Greek mathematician and philosopher Plato.

**Archimedean solids** are a little bit less regular that Platonic solids: you are allowed to use multiple different kids of regular polygons. There are 13 Archimedean solids, and they are named after the Greek mathematician Archimedes.

    body: `The goal of this app is to find polygons hidden around the museum or exhibition. Once you have collected sufficient polygons, they combine to make Platonic or Archimedean solids.

To collect a polygon, scan its **QR code** with your phone. It is important to line up the QR code with the green rectangle that appears when you tap "Scan a new shape". Every shape can only be scanned once.

A different way to get additional polygons is to answer questions and get **powerups**. You also get **badges** for completing certain tasks.
