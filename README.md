# PolygON

A mobile app for mathematics museums and science centers. Visitors can discover regular polygons hidden around the exhibition, and use them to generate regular polyhedra.


## Development

First, you need to install XCode and React Native, by following the instructions at https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html.

Now install all dependencies of this app by running `npm install`.

Finally, start the App in iOS simulator by running `react-native run-ios`.


## TODO list

* Powerups: locked, b/w, better questions
* About screen + subscreens

* Polyhedron screens (Images, SVG download)
* Tutorial, help messages across app
* Swap shapes screen

* Code signing and App Store release
* Android support, Web version?

* Nicer and customisable QR codes
* Interactive rotations, folding animation


## 3d Model Generation

* Generate model in Cheeta3D and export to Video
* Convert to PNG frames in Adobe Media encoder
* Generate @3x assets using https://github.com/lukszar/iOS-Images-Prepare
* Compress using Pngyu and ImageOptim.
