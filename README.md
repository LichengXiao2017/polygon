# PolygON

A mobile app for mathematics museums and science centers. Visitors can discover
regular polygons hidden around the exhibition, and use them to generate regular
polyhedra.


## Getting Started

First, you need to install XCode and React Native, by following the instructions
at https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html.

the simulator using `npm run ios` or `npm run android`.
